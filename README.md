# jpg-to-pdf-converter
You want to be able to say "python converter.py" and then give it 2 Arguments.
  1st Argument is the Folder Name that contains all the images that you want to convert. Here its "Images"
  2nd is the New Folder that I want to create. Therefore, I have called it "PDFs" [This folder does not exist but you want to be able to create it doing this]
When you run the command, it going to look through all the images in the "Images" Folder, convert them, and put them in a new("PDFs") Folder
