# jpg-to-pdf-converter
You want to be able to say "python converter.py" and then give it 2 Arguments.
  1st Argument is the Folder Name that contains all the images that you want to convert. Here its "Images" and 
  2nd is the New Folder that you want to create. Therefore, I have called it "PDFs" here. [This folder does not exist but you want to be able to create it doing this]

When you run the command, it going to look through all the images in the "Images" Folder, convert them, and put them in a new("PDFs") Folder
